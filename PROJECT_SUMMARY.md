## Database Schema Details

### employees
```sql
- employee_id (PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
- first_name, last_name
- email (UNIQUE)
- phone, role
- password_hash
- hire_date
- active (BOOLEAN)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### customers
```sql
- customer_id (PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
- first_name, last_name

- created_at, updated_at
```

### pizzas
```sql
- pizza_id (PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
- name, description
- size (Small/Medium/Large)
- base_price (DECIMAL)
- category
- available (BOOLEAN)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### orders
```sql
- order_id (PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
- customer_id (FK → customers)
- employee_id (FK → employees)
- order_date (TIMESTAMP)
- subtotal (DECIMAL)
- tax_rate (DECIMAL, default 0.0700)

```

## Sales Tax Calculation Flow

1. **Order Creation**:
   - User selects customer
   - User adds pizzas with quantities
   - System calculates subtotal: Σ(quantity × unit_price)

2. **Tax Calculation**:
   - Tax rate (default 7%, customizable per order)
   - Tax amount = subtotal × tax_rate
   - Rounded to 2 decimal places

3. **Total Calculation**:
   - Total amount = subtotal + tax_amount
   - Displayed in real-time on order form
   - Stored in database with order

4. **Display**:
   - Order summary shows: Subtotal, Tax (with %), Total
   - Order history shows all three values
   - Dashboard shows total sales (with tax included)
